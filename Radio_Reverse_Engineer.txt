tutorial for SDR reverse radio engineering

Radio Replay
Visit fcc.io/ and search fccid // Open GQRX, scan spectrum for frequency
Open GRC, pipe osmocom source into file sync
	Set proper base frq, bandwidth, sample rate, take into account DC offset
	In another file, pipe *.sink output into osmocom sink,  proper parameters

Reverse Radio Engineer
Visit fcc.io/ and search fccid // Open GQRX, scan spectrum for frequency 
Open osmocom_fft, record into *.cfile
Open *.cfile in inspectrum
Vary settings to attain proper display
Open screenruler and measure x number of smalles pulses
Compare length to time on the side of display
Divide t of n pulses by n
Divide 1 sec by t of 1 pulse
Use t of 1 pulse to determine baud
Decode entire pulse, compare if other transmissions available
Deduce preamble/sync
Execute sudo ./rfcat -r
